This project showcases a simple microservices architecture implemented with gRPC in Go. It consists of four core services: API Gateway, Auth Service, Order Service, and Product Service. The goal of the project is to provide a foundational understanding of building microservices with gRPC in Go. Each service is dedicated to a specific domain and communicates with others through gRPC:

Auth Service: Handles user authentication and authorization, including login and signup functionality.

Order Service: Oversees order management, including the creation and retrieval of orders.

Product Service: Manages product data, such as adding new products and retrieving product details.
